# HTTP 3

## üìå Introduction
HTTP 3 is the latest evolution of the HTTP protocol, built on top of **QUIC** (Quick UDP Internet Connections), a transport protocol developed by Google. Officially standardized in 2022 (RFC 9114), HTTP 3 addresses core limitations in previous versions by moving away from TCP entirely and embracing **UDP** for faster, more resilient performance ‚Äî especially under modern internet conditions.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **QUIC-based transport**: Uses UDP instead of TCP, eliminating TCP's head-of-line blocking.
- **0-RTT Connection Establishment**: Resumes previous connections instantly with cached credentials.
- **Built-in Encryption**: TLS 1.3 is natively integrated into the protocol.
- **Connection Migration**: Seamless switching between networks without reconnecting (e.g., Wi-Fi to mobile).
- **Improved congestion control and packet loss recovery**.

## ‚ùó Problems in HTTP 2 Solved by HTTP 3

| HTTP 2 Limitation                   | HTTP 3 Solution                                          |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| TCP Head-of-Line blocking          | QUIC allows independent streams over UDP                |
| Slow handshake (TCP + TLS)         | 0-RTT QUIC handshake (TLS 1.3)                          |
| Poor mobile switching support      | QUIC‚Äôs Connection IDs enable seamless migration         |
| TCP-level connection loss          | QUIC keeps streams alive during network changes         |
| Difficulty debugging packet loss   | Built-in loss detection & recovery in QUIC              |

## ‚úÖ Benefits Over Previous Versions

- ‚úÖ **Speed**: Dramatically lower latency than HTTP 2.
- ‚úÖ **Reliability**: Better handling of unreliable/mobile networks.
- ‚úÖ **Security**: TLS 1.3 baked directly into the protocol.
- ‚úÖ **Efficiency**: Improved congestion and flow control.

## üßæ Conclusion
HTTP 3 is a modern reimagining of web communication, designed with today‚Äôs internet challenges in mind ‚Äî mobile browsing, streaming, and global latency. By leveraging QUIC over UDP, it solves the core weaknesses of HTTP 2 (like TCP's head-of-line blocking) and brings us into a faster, more reliable web future.
