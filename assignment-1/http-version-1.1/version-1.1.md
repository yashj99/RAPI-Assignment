# HTTP 1.1

## üìå Introduction
Released in 1997, HTTP 1.1 built upon HTTP 1.0 and became the most widely adopted version of HTTP for over a decade. It introduced performance enhancements and essential features that made web applications faster, more scalable, and more reliable.

HTTP 1.1 addressed the major limitations of HTTP 1.0, especially around connection reuse, host resolution, and caching.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Persistent connections** (keep-alive by default).
- Mandatory **Host header** (supports virtual hosting).
- **Chunked transfer encoding** for dynamic content.
- **Pipelining**: Allows sending multiple requests without waiting for responses.
- **Improved caching** with headers like `ETag`, `Cache-Control`, `Vary`.
- **100 Continue** interim response to optimize POST requests.
- **OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE** methods added.

## ‚ùó Problems in HTTP 1.0
1. **No persistent connections:** Each request requires a new TCP connection.
2. **No standardized host header (initially):** Couldn‚Äôt host multiple domains on one IP easily.
3. **Limited caching mechanisms:** Only basic headers like `Expires` and `Last-Modified`.
4. **Latency due to connection overhead:** Multiple requests = multiple connections.
5. **No pipelining or multiplexing support.**

## ‚úÖ How New Versions Solved It
### HTTP 1.1 introduced:
- **Persistent connections** by default using `Connection: keep-alive`.
- **Host header mandatory**, enabling **virtual hosting**.
- Better **caching support** with headers like `ETag`, `Cache-Control`.
- Support for **chunked transfer encoding** (send data in chunks).
- **Pipelining**: Multiple requests can be sent before responses are received.

## üßæ Conclusion
HTTP 1.1 brought significant improvements over HTTP 1.0 and became the backbone of the modern web for many years. However, as web apps became more resource-heavy and dynamic, HTTP 1.1 began to show its limitations, paving the way for HTTP 2.
