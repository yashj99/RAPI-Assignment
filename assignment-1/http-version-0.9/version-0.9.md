# HTTP 0.9

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
HTTP 0.9 was the very first version of the HyperText Transfer Protocol, introduced in 1991. It was extremely simple and designed solely for transferring raw HTML documents from servers to clients (usually browsers). 

This version did not support headers, status codes, or any complex functionality. It was purely about retrieving HTML content.

- Connection closes after each request.

## ðŸ§¾ Conclusion
HTTP 0.9 laid the groundwork for the modern web but was extremely limited. It served its purpose in a simpler time, but as the internet grew, so did the need for a more robust protocol. This led to HTTP 1.0 and beyond.
